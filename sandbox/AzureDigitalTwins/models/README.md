## A Candidate Manufacturing Ontology ##
### Background ###
Early in 2021, we began pulling together various discussions, papers and standards on the subject of standardising digital twins in manufacturing and related industries. Through our involvement with the Digital Twins Consortium (DTC) we learned of efforts to agree interoperability and ontological standards. However, progress has been relatively slow in this area. As a result, due to our own pressing needs, we have developed this Candidate Manufacturing Ontology, specifically for use with Azure Digital Twins (ADT).
This ontology pays respect to many existing standards and discussion papers, each of which has influenced this ontology as explained here.

This academic research paper lays out analysis conducted across the entire knowledgebase regarding the subject. The research discusses the merits and drawbacks of various standards and existing approaches to manufacturing data and how these apply to Industry 4.0 and beyond. In conclusion there are a number of conclusive recommendations made as to how to ensure future ontologies solve the challenges of limited depth and expressiveness in the current ontologies.

Our work incorporates some of the key findings of this paper.
